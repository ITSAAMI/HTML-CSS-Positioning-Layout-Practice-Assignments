Welcome to the HTML and CSS positioning project repository! This project focuses on using floor positioning properties to create lists with alternating image and text layouts. 

## Project Overview
In this project, students will create lists with images and texts positioned differently using floor positioning properties. The layout for each list will be as follows:

1. The first list will have an image on the left side and text on the right.
2. The second list will have an image on the right side and text on the left.
3. Students will submit their final HTML and CSS code in their respective folders.

## Project Instructions
- Create an HTML file (`index.html`) that contains the lists.
- Use CSS to position the image and text using floor positioning properties.
- Make sure the layout is clean, responsive, and well-organized.
- Submit your project by placing the code in the folder with your name.
